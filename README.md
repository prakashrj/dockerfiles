dockerfiles
===========

We can directly build a docker from git without cloning or downlading the repo. It's very convenient as I can save all my work here and images in index.docker.io 

Ideally all my work must be in Git or index.docker.io. With the intention of keeping it that way, I am planning to save all my work here.
